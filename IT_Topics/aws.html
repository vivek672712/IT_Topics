                <h3>AWS EC2 Pricing</h3>
                <p>AWS EC2 pricing varies based on several factors including instance type, region, and usage duration. Here’s a basic overview:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>On-Demand Instances:</strong> Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments. This pricing is ideal for applications with unpredictable workloads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reserved Instances:</strong> Commit to using EC2 instances for a one or three-year term in exchange for a significant discount compared to on-demand pricing. Suitable for applications with predictable workloads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spot Instances:</strong> Purchase unused EC2 capacity at a reduced rate. Spot Instances are ideal for flexible, fault-tolerant applications and can offer substantial savings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dedicated Hosts:</strong> Allocate an entire physical server to your use. This option is useful for compliance and licensing requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dedicated Instances:</strong> Run instances on hardware that’s dedicated to your use, but without the full isolation provided by Dedicated Hosts.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Pricing also varies by region, as different regions have different costs associated with data centers. To get an accurate estimate, you can use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">AWS Pricing Calculator</a>.</p>

                <h2>AWS EC2 Scaling</h2>
                <h3>Scaling EC2 Instances</h3>
                <p>Scaling EC2 instances allows you to adjust your compute capacity based on demand. AWS provides two main types of scaling:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down):</strong> Involves changing the instance type to a more powerful or less powerful instance. This can be useful when you need to handle increased workloads or reduce costs. For example, upgrading from a <code>t3.medium</code> instance to a <code>t3.large</code> for more compute power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In):</strong> Involves adding or removing instances in a fleet. This method increases or decreases the number of instances based on traffic or workload. It is commonly used with Auto Scaling Groups to automatically adjust the number of running instances.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Auto Scaling Groups</h3>
                <p>Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand. You can configure policies to scale out (add more instances) or scale in (remove instances) based on metrics such as CPU utilization or request count.</p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code>
            -- Example: Auto Scaling Policy to scale out when CPU utilization exceeds 80%
            -- This is typically set up in the AWS Management Console or using AWS CLI/SDKs
            
            aws autoscaling put-scaling-policy --auto-scaling-group-name my-auto-scaling-group \
            --policy-name scale-out --scaling-adjustment 1 --adjustment-type ChangeInCapacity \
            --cooldown 300
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>This example demonstrates how to create a scaling policy that increases the number of instances by one when CPU utilization exceeds 80%. You can configure similar policies for scaling in, as well as based on other metrics and thresholds.</p>

                <h2>AWS Cloud Auto Scaling</h2>
                <p>AWS Auto Scaling helps you maintain application performance and availability by automatically adjusting the number of EC2 instances in response to varying demand. It ensures that you have the right number of instances available at all times to handle your application’s workload.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Features of AWS Auto Scaling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Scaling:</strong> Automatically scales the number of EC2 instances based on defined policies and conditions, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, or custom metrics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scaling Policies:</strong> Define when and how to scale your resources. Policies can be based on thresholds for metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, or application load.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scheduled Scaling:</strong> Automatically adjusts the number of instances at predefined times, such as increasing capacity during peak hours and decreasing it during off-peak hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Monitors the health of your instances and replaces any that are unhealthy to maintain high availability.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Setting Up Auto Scaling</h3>
                <p>To set up Auto Scaling, you need to create an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and define scaling policies. You can do this through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs.</p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code>
            -- Example: Create an Auto Scaling Group with a minimum of 2 instances and a maximum of 5 instances
            
            aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
            --launch-configuration-name my-launch-configuration --min-size 2 --max-size 5 \
            --desired-capacity 2 --availability-zones us-east-1a us-east-1b
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>This example creates an Auto Scaling Group named <code>my-asg</code> with a minimum of 2 instances, a maximum of 5 instances, and an initial desired capacity of 2. It spans two availability zones to enhance fault tolerance.</p>
                
                <h3>Scaling Policies</h3>
                <pre>
                    <code>
            -- Example: Create a scaling policy to increase capacity by 1 instance when CPU utilization exceeds 70%
            
            aws autoscaling put-scaling-policy --auto-scaling-group-name my-asg \
            --policy-name scale-out --scaling-adjustment 1 --adjustment-type ChangeInCapacity \
            --cooldown 300
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>This example sets up a policy that increases the number of instances by 1 when CPU utilization exceeds 70%. The <code>cooldown</code> period ensures that scaling actions are not executed too frequently.</p>

            <section id="aws_cloud_elastic_load_balancing">
                <h2>AWS Cloud Elastic Load Balancing</h2>
                <p>AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. This helps to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for your applications.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Load Balancers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB):</strong> Operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and is ideal for load balancing HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It supports advanced routing features, such as host-based and path-based routing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network Load Balancer (NLB):</strong> Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is designed to handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latency. It is suitable for TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):</strong> Provides a transparent network gateway for distributing traffic across virtual appliances such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems. It combines the features of a Layer 3 and Layer 4 load balancer with network and security appliance integration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Classic Load Balancer (CLB):</strong> Operates at both Layer 4 and Layer 7 and is used for legacy applications that do not require the advanced features provided by ALB and NLB. CLB is being phased out in favor of ALB and NLB.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Setting Up a Load Balancer</h3>
                <p>To set up an Elastic Load Balancer, you need to create and configure the load balancer, set up listeners, and define target groups. This can be done through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs.</p>
